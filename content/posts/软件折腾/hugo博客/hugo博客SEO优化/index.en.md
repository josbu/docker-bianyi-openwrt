When submitting a page index to bing today, it gave some optimization advice:：
1. More than one h1 tag
```text {linenos=false}
More than one h1 tag

- 4 instances found

How to fix?

What is the issue about?These pages have more than one <h1> tag. Multiple <h1> header tags might confuse search engine bots and website's users. It is recommended to use only one <h1> tag per page.

How to fix?

Remove redundant <h1> tags from the page source, so that only one <h1> tag exists.
```

2. Meta Description too long or too short
```text {linenos=false}
Meta Description too long or too short

- 1 instance found

How to fix?

What is the issue about?
Search engine crawlers only show the first 150-160 characters of the description in the search results page, so if a description is too long, searchers may not see all of the text. If a description is too short, the search engines may add text found elsewhere on the page. Note that search engines may show a different description from the one you have authored if they feel it may be more relevant to a user's search.

How to fix?

Change the description in the <meta description> tag in the page source to be between 25 and 160 characters in length.
```
